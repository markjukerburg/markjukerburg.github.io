# Udacity Front-end Nonodegree - Project 1
## Udacity Portfolio Site

This project is the first project of the Udacity Front-end Nonodegree Program. It is a simple one page portfolio featuring responsive design using the bootstrap framework. 

I have refactored the code to include a simple about section along with adding my other projects from the nanodegree.
